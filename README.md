This project analyzed data from the french-bakery-daily-sales dataset from Kaggle (*Dataset Kaggle Page*: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matthieugimbert/french-bakery-daily-sales).


## Key findings from each section:

*Descriptive Analysis*:

- The daily revenue of the bakery changes over time, generating anywhere between $500 and $3,500, with peak revenue being in the months of July and August.
- There tends to be a large dropoff in the number of orders taken after 1pm.
- The days of the week that have the greatest total revenue of all time are Saturday and Sunday.
- The traditional baguette is the best selling product by a large margin.


*Inferential Analysis*:

There is evidence to support:
- The average daily revenue in August of 2021 is significantly different from the average daily revenue in July of 2021.
- The distribution of daily revenue on weekends is significantly greater than the distribution of daily revenue on the weekdays.
- The average total number of orders placed before 1pm are significantly different from the average total number of orders placed after 1pm.
